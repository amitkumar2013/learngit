Workflows:
1. Master Workflow - each line of work is rebased and sequentially merged to master.
2. Feature Workflow - each line of work is branched off master and shared among owners before finally merging it off to master.
3. Git Workflow - There are 5 branch types.
                a. Master which is mostly tagged and main.
                b. Develop spinned off from master for development.
                c. Feature spinned off from Develop branches; worked and then merged back to Develop.
                d. Release branched off from Develop after Features are merged/complete. 
                e. Fix branches branched and merged in Master.
4. Fork Workflow - Copy of remote repo for each owner.
